<h2>NY_TAXI_TRIP_PREDICTION</h2>

Repository contains model trying to predict trip duration in New York.

It was based on kaggle competition, which provided datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration

My goal was different than the one proposed in competition, as I wanted to predict basicly any car ride, not specificly a cab ride

<b>UNTER NEW YORK TAXI TRIP PREDICTION</b> --  contains basic exploration of data set, and testing many algorithms

<b>ny_taxi_prod_model </b> -- is trying to get as good result as posible with GradientBoostedTrees

If you have any comments or recomendations, please let me know.
