<h1>NY_TAXI_TRIP_PREDICTION</h1>

<img src="https://media.cntraveller.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nyctaxilead-866x487.jpg">

Repository contains model trying to predict trip duration in New York.

It was based on kaggle competition, which provided datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration

My goal was different than the one proposed in competition, as I wanted to predict basicly any car ride, not specificly a cab ride
<br><br>
<h4>Repo contains two notebooks:</h4>

<ul>
<li><h4>UNTER NEW YORK TAXI TRIP PREDICTION</h4> --  contains basic exploration of data set, and testing many algorithms</li>

<li><h4>ny_taxi_prod_model </h4> -- is trying to get as good result as posible with <b>GradientBoostedTrees<b></li>

</ul>
